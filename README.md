## üóÇ How Each JSON Config is Used

- **contactData.json**: Demo data for contacts (used for initial state and UI demo).
- **contactFields.json**: Defines all possible fields and folders (sections) for a contact. Controls which fields appear, their types, validation, and grouping.
- **conversationData.json**: Demo data for conversations/messages and replies, used in the conversation UI.
- **layout.json**: Determines the order, grouping, and layout (span/columns) of sections in the responsive contact layout. Used by the `useResponsiveContactLayout` hook to render the UI dynamically.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- Layout JSON file was not utilised because of minimal clarity.
- The app uses static demo data; no backend or real API integration is present.
- Some field types (e.g., file upload, advanced validation) may be placeholders or not fully implemented.
- Some UI/UX polish and accessibility improvements are ongoing.
